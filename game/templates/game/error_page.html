<h2>Error</h2>
<p>We're sorry; it looks like the combination of households and their members will not 
work for this game. This is likely due to one household having more than half of the total number of names being drawn.
Please use the play by group option. Note: The system will no longer be able to prevent drawing names of members of the same household. </p>
