Welcome to my Secret Santa Name Generator!

This is my first Python and Django project since starting to program in September of 2020. 

If you would like to replicate this in your own environment, first be sure you have pipenv installed as that is what is used as the virtual environment.

Then, do a simple <en>pipenv install</en> to install the dependencies. 

Current state has limit functionallity, but it can generate the list of names. 

Please let me know your thoughts!
