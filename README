Welcome to my Secret Santa Name Generator!

This is my first Python and Django project since starting to program in September of 2020. 

If your family is like mine, then you know the struggle of picking secret santa names each year.
Whether it is picking a name multiple times because you picked your own name or a name of someone in your household, 
or it's the struggle of being together to pick all the names at one time. It is always a struggle. And in most cases, at least in my family,
we end up finding out who has who ahead of time. 

My idea behind this project is to solve all of the above issues.

The primary goal of this secret santa name generator is to be able to take (n) number of households, containing (n) number of household members,
and instantly generate the secret santa names. 

To solve the issue of making sure no one knows who has who, the program will either email and/or text each member of the game,
who they have as their secret santa recipient. 

The secondary goal is to be able to take one big group of people, say an office environment, and simply generate the names and again email and/or text the results.

This is very much a work in progress. 

Let me know your thoughts!

To get started with replicating this repo, start by cloning the project:

    - This repo runs using Python 3.8. Unsure if it will work with other versions at this time.
    - Open the terminal and cd to root directory of project.
    - The virtual environment used in this is pipenv. If not already installed, run 'pip3 install' pipenv.
    - With pipenv installed, run 'pipenv install' to create the virtual environment, and automatically install the dependencies noted in the Pipfile.lock file.
    - Be sure to change the Python interpreter to the new virtual environment path. 
    - Run 'python manage.py migrate' to create and migrate the database.
    - Run 'python manage.py runserver'. 
    - A super user needs to be created in order to access the admin panel. Run 'python manage.py createsuperuser'. 

At this point, the game is functionable. However, the text messaging feature will not work with a cloned repo unless you have your own Twilio account and create a .env file. If you create a .env file, you need to enter the TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID, TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN and TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER in this file. 

Let me know how things work for you!
